1. **Justify or Remove** — Every element must demonstrate measurable utility (⌐■_■)
   > _If you can't explain why it exists, it shouldn't_
2. **Type with Precision** — Static typing prevents more errors than tests 🛡️
   > _Types are firewalls between intention and mistake_
3. **Name for Comprehension** — Naming is a compression algorithm for intent 🏷️
   > _Good names are documentation that can't become outdated_
4. **Preserve Compatibility** — Breaking changes reveal design failures 🧩
   > _Elegant solutions evolve without breaking what relies on them_
5. **Know When to Stop** — Excessive optimization is premature complexity ⏱️
   > _Perfect is the enemy of elegant; elegant is the friend of maintainable_

```python
def refine(component: Component) -> Component:
  """Recursively optimize until further changes would reduce value."""
  while has_unnecessary_elements(component):
    component = remove_unjustified_elements(component)

  while has_imprecise_types(component):
    component = strengthen_type_definitions(component)

  while has_unclear_names(component):
    component = improve_naming(component)

  # Recursive optimization stops when elegance emerges
  return component  # Now as simple as possible, but no simpler
```

- **Fractal Coherence** — Systems must remain comprehensible at every scale 🔬🔭
  > _Zoom in, zoom out, same elegant logic applies_
- **Explicit Boundaries** — Fail loudly at integration points, never silently 📢
  > _Silent failures become mysterious production incidents_
- **Deterministic Processing** — Identical inputs must produce identical outputs ⚙️
  > _Debugging randomness is like finding a specific drop in the ocean_
- **Resource Awareness** — Memory constraints aren't limitations, they're specifications 📊
  > _The best solutions acknowledge the resources they consume_

```typescript
interface RefinedSystem<T> {
  // Returns error or result—never throws or fails silently
  process(input: T): Either<ProcessingError, ProcessingResult>;

  // Guarantees identical outputs for identical inputs
  readonly deterministic: true;

  // Resource consumption is contractual
  readonly resourceProfile: ResourceRequirements;
}

- 🎯 **Function**: Transforms raw user input into validated credentials
-
- 💡 **Rationale**: Centralizes validation logic to prevent duplicate
- implementations. Alternative approaches using middleware were
- rejected due to cross-cutting concerns.
-
- 🔍 **Examples**:
- ```typescript

  ```

- // Standard case
- parseCredentials({ username: "user", password: "pass" })
- // => { username: "user", passwordHash: "a1b2c3...", valid: true }
-
- // Edge case: Empty input
- parseCredentials({})
- // => { valid: false, errors: ["Missing required fields"] }
- ```

  ```

-
- 🌐 **Integration**:
- - Called by: AuthController.login(), UserService.register()
- - Depends on: HashingService, ValidationRules
-
- 🔄 **Evolution**:
- - v2.1: Added support for MFA tokens
- - v2.0: Switched to Argon2 hashing
- - v1.0: Initial implementation with bcrypt

## 🔮 Implementation Protocol 🛠️

```ascii

║ The recursive path from concept to elegant execution   ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

1. **Pure First, Effects Later** — Side effects belong at the edges ⚛️
   > _Pure functions are testable, composable, and comprehensible_
2. **Compose, Don't Inherit** — Hierarchy creates fragility 🧩
   > _Inheritance is a contract written in permanent ink_
3. **Errors as Values** — Exceptions hide control flow 🎯
   > _When errors are values, handling them becomes explicit_
4. **Data Before Behavior** — Define what something is before what it does 📊
   > _Structure determines behavior, not the other way around_
5. **Test at Boundaries** — Systems break at their edges, not their centers 🧪
   > _Integration points reveal assumptions your unit tests didn't_

```go
// Bad: Mixed concerns, hidden effects, exception-based flow
func ProcessOrder(order Order) {
  if !ValidateOrder(order) {
    throw new ValidationException("Invalid order");
  }
  SaveOrder(order);  // Side effect in the middle of logic
  NotifyUser(order.UserId);  // Another side effect
  return "Success";
}

// Good: Pure core with effects at edges, error as value
func ProcessOrder(order Order) Result {
  validationResult := ValidateOrder(order)
  if !validationResult.IsValid() {
    return Result.Failure(validationResult.Errors())
  }

  // Pure transformation
  processedOrder := EnrichOrder(order)

  // Effects clearly grouped at the end
  return orderRepository.SaveOrder(processedOrder)
    .AndThen(func() { return notificationService.NotifyUser(order.UserId) })
}

Refinement is complete when removing any element would break functionality—and not a moment before. The most elegant solution feels inevitable, as if mathematics itself ordained its structure. When you achieve this state, your code appears so natural that alternatives seem obviously flawed.

(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ _"If it seems complex, you're not done refining."_ (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

```typescript
// Before refinement: State validity depends on runtime checks
type ConnectionState = {
  isConnected: boolean;
  hasError: boolean;
  errorMessage?: string;
};
// Invalid states possible: {isConnected: true, hasError: true}

// After refinement: Invalid states are unrepresentable
type ConnectionState =
  | { status: "connected" }
  | { status: "disconnected" }
  | { status: "error"; message: string };
// The type system enforces validity
```
